# urweb-color-thing-T

This code is identical to the code for the other repository `urweb-color-thing-THING` except:

- Here the "child" table is named `t` - and in the other repository it is named `thing`

The code in *this* repo (using table named `t`) compiles and runs fine!

The code in the *other* repo (identical but using table named `thing`) does not compile.

The compile error messages for the other repository are shown in the other repo's Issue 1.

Thanks for any help!
