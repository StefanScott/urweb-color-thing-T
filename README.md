# urweb-color-thing-T

The code in this repo is identical to the code in the other repo [`urweb-color-thing-THING`](https://github.com/StefanScott/urweb-color-thing-THING) except:

- Here the "child" table is named `t` - and in the other repository it is named `thing`

The code in *this* repo (using table named `t`) compiles and runs fine!

The code in the *other* repo (identical but using table named `thing`) does not compile.

The compile error messages for the other repository are shown in [the other repo's Issue 1](https://github.com/StefanScott/urweb-color-thing-THING/issues/1).

Thanks for any help!
