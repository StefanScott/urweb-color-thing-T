# urweb-color-thing-T

This code is identical to the code for the other repository urweb-color-thing-THING except:

- Here the table is named `t` - and in the other repository it is named `thing`

This code compiles and runs fine!

The code in the other does not compile.

The compile error message for the other repository are shown in that repo's Issue 1.

Thanks for any help!
